# Entity Framework Project

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create an application in which users can either buy or sell products. Customers should be able to browse through the products, place orders and view these orders. Sellers should be able to list all of their available products, view how well these products are doing and manage a list of all currently placed orders.
